15/12/24 - Implemented the finite element method on the 1D Poisson's equation and added adaptive mesh refinement.


16/12/24 - Added general Robin boundary conditions of the form u'(x) = k * (u(x) - g) to the solution. Completion of Chapter 2 of (1).


15/01/25 - Implemented a 2D Laplace's equation solver with a self-programmed mesher. Solution verified with solving potential flow around a cylinder.
